11/3/2016 12:52PM: I have begun contruction on project three with files for game data, external files, an LLL, and a table.  I have yet to begin on the table because the LLL is giving me a double free error when I try at the end of main because something is being deleted twice and I cant figure it out.  I was looking at the destructors and the add node function for answers, try looking there.

11/3/2016 8:58PM: I have gotten really far in my project.  I have begun building a hash function and have made a data file to load data from the file to the project. The next thing I need to work on is the extra game that gets loaded that is garbage and the hash function returning a number. While the name is bought bak to the hash function the index is blank.  fix that next time.

11/4/2016 9:52AM: I have almost fnished my hash table.  I realized that the linked list file is not needed to complete this assignment.  I still have the files in case I am wrong but I have made it so no files need the linked list files.  In this case  copied the node struct into the table files.  I dont even need a head pointer because each element in the array for the hash table acts as a head which I can then access the linked list from there.  I still need to build a display function for the hash table so I will work on that next.

11/4/2016 9:16PM:  I hae made stides and bounds to the program.  I have made a retrive function, set up a main menu, and tested my insert with chains.  I finished the destutors to the point where I have no memory leaks.  The next thing I need to work on is making it so that when the user is searching for a game or when a game is put into the table to make the game name all lower case.  I need to find the library that allows me to use toupper and tolower.

11/8/2016 10:21PM: I have almost completed the removal function for the table.  The app part of removing is not working but I will work on it next time.  After that it s just seaching by platform.
